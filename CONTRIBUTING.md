## 🎯 Ways to Contribute

### 1. Report Bugs

Found something broken? [Open an issue](../../issues) with:
- What you expected vs. what happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your environment (OS, Python version, Claude Code version)

### 2. Request Skills or Suggest Improvements

Want a new skill or enhancement? [Open an issue](../../issues) with:
- **For new skills:** Which API/service you want integrated and your use case
- **For improvements:** What you want changed and why
- Examples or references (if helpful)

### 3. About Skill Code

Skills are generated using a generator. If you find issues with a skill, please **open an issue** rather than submitting PRs to modify skill code directly.

If there's sufficient interest, we plan to release the generator for creating your own skills.
